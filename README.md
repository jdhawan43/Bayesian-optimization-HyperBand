# Bayesian-optimization-HyperBand
Analysing different optimization techniques

The aim of this exercise was to learn the implementation of both Bayesian optimization and Hyperband. And how to combine 
both to perform the hyperparameter optimization of a CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset. 

We were given a  surrogate (random forest as regression model) benchmark to avoid the training up of a
CNN network and to evaluate the hyperparameter configuration faster
